        <span> tags are utilized to bold key phrases to make content more easily scannable and emphasize important pieces of information
        Always follow a proper heading structure with <h3> as the top level heading (h2 is the title of the info drawer), and <h4> for subheadings
        All heading tags are automatically bolded, so no <span> tag is necessary
        Avoid use of <br/> tags, instead group text into a new <p> tag to achieve a break line for consistency.

      <h2>Microsoft Teams Webhook Guide</h2>

      <p>
        Webhooks in Microsoft Teams allow Tombolo to deliver notifications and updates directly into a Teams channel.
        Webhooks post these updates directly into the chat stream which can be handled and responded to in order to keep
        your team on top of important notifications.
      </p>

      <h3>Create Incoming Webhooks</h3>
      <p>To add an Incoming Webhook to a Teams channel, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Open the channel in which you want to add the webhook and select <span>•••</span> from the upper-right
            corner.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Select <span>Connectors</span> from the dropdown menu.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Select <span>Configure</span>, and provide a name for your webhook.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Copy and save the unique webhook URL present in the dialog. The URL maps to the channel and you can use it
            to send information to Teams.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Select Done.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The webhook is now available in the Teams channel. Simply provide the copied URL in the field inside of Tombolo,
        and configured notifications will begin to appear in the channel.
      </p>
    </div>
