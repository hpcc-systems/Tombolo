        The "Add Asset" feature in Tombolo allows you to import assets and their metadata from an HPCC cluster. You can
        also add additional metadata to the imported asset and use it to create data flows. This version of Tombolo
        enables you to import files, jobs, queries, and indexes. Additionally, you can create file templates and
        generate Real-BI dashboards.

            For files, you can search and import logical files into Tombolo using the auto-complete search field or the
            file explorer. To use the auto-complete search, you must input at least three characters. You can view the
            file layout and add permissible purposes and constraints if desired. If you have the correct permissions,
            you can also preview the file inside Tombolo

        <Panel header="Job" key="2" style={panelStyle}>
          <p>
            For jobs, you can search and import them using the auto-complete search feature. A minimum of three
            characters is required to trigger a lookup. You can view the ECL associated with the job and its input and
            output files. You can also import jobs from GitHub. To do so, you must first add the GitHub project. To
            import jobs from GitHub, you must first add the GitHub project. You can access the UI to add a GitHub
            project by clicking on the GitHub Projects link in the left navigation bar.

        <Panel header="Index" key="3" style={panelStyle}>
          <p>
            For indexes, you can search and add them using the auto-complete search field. A minimum of three characters
            is required to trigger the search. You can view the payload and workunit related to the imported indexes.
          </p>
        </Panel>
        <Panel header="Query" key="4" style={panelStyle}>
          <p>
            For queries, you can search and add them using the auto-complete search field like any other assets. You can
            view the input fields, output fields, and files related to the imported queries.
          </p>
        </Panel>
        <Panel header="File Template" key="5" style={panelStyle}>
          <p>
            File templates can be created to group logical files. If a workflow has many files, and it is cluttering the
            graph, file templates can be used to group files and tidy up the workspace. Additionally, file templates can
            be used for monitoring files in landing zones and triggering workflows. For example, if you want to watch a
            directory in a landing zone and trigger a workflow when a file with a particular file pattern is uploaded,
            you can create a file template and add it to a dataflow to accomplish that.
          </p>
        </Panel>
        <Panel header="Real-BI Dashboard" key="6" style={panelStyle}>
          <p>
            You can visualize logical file data by creating a Real-BI dashboard. To integrate this feature, the Real BI
            URL must be added to the environment variable on the server.
