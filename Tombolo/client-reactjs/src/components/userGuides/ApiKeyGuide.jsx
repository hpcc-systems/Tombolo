        <span>URL Structure</span>
      </h3>
      <p>The basic URL structure is</p>
      <p>
        <span>BASEURL/api/apikeys/APPLICATIONID/KEY/DATA</span>
      </p>
      <p>Below are descriptions of each portion of the URL.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>
            <span>BASEURL</span>
          </h4>

          <p>
            The base URL of your tombolo instance can be found by looking at your current tombolo instance URL and
            selecting everything before the application ID.
          </p>
          <p>In the following example: </p>
          <p>https://tombolo.com/b8431e6e-2b5e-4889-9127-9bdaa0a09d71/dashboard</p>
          <p>the base url is https://tombolo.com</p>

        <li>
          <h4>
            <span>APPLICATIONID</span>
          </h4>

          <p>
            The APPLICATIONID can be found by looking at your current tombolo instance URL and selecting everything
            between the base url and your current page directory.
          </p>
          <p>In the following example: </p>
          <p>https://tombolo.com/b8431e6e-2b5e-4889-9127-9bdaa0a09d71/dashboard</p>
          <p>the application ID is b8431e6e-2b5e-4889-9127-9bdaa0a09d71</p>

          <h4>
            <span>KEY</span>

          <p>Replace KEY with your generated API key.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>clusterusage</span> - This will return cluster storage history data available on the cluster
              dashboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>notifications</span> - This will return notification history data available on the notifications

          </h4>
          <p>Paramter options are as follows</p>
          <p>
            <span>first</span> - Selects only the first provided number of results.
          </p>
          <p>Example: ?first=10 will only return the first 10 results.</p>
          <p>
            <span>offset</span> - Offsets the start of results returned, can be utilized in conjunction with first for
            pagination.
          </p>
          <p>Example: ?offset=10 will return all results after the first 10.</p>
          <p>
            <span>Multiple Parameters</span> - Multiple parameters can be set for the same query. Each parameter will be
            seperated by the & character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: ?first=10&offset=10 will return the first 10 results after the first 10 are skipped. This structure
            can be utilized to return paginated results.

      <h3>
        <span>Usage Limits</span>
      </h3>
      <p>To protect the integerity and security of our data, we have set usage limits on each key</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>
            <span>Every 15 minutes</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            API Keys are limited to <span>400</span> calls every 15 minutes.

        <li>
          <h4>
            <span>Key Lifespan</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            API Keys are limited to <span>1000 multiplied by the total number of days the key is active for</span>{' '}
            calls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: Keys expire after 14 days. The total number of calls the key will be able to make is 1000 * 14 =
            14000.
          </p>

        <span>Expiration Date</span>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            To protect the integerity and security of our data, we have set a default active time period for each key of{' '}
            <span>28 days</span>. Each key will have an expiration date set 28 days from the creation time of said key.
            You
            {`'`}ll need to speak with an administrator to adjust the default length, with a maximum possible value of
            365 days.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We only keep record of expired keys for 365 days, per industry standard.</p>
