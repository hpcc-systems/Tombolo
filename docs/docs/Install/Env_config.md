# Environment Configurations

To get the Tombolo app up and running, there are two key configuration files that need to be edited:

1. **General Environment File (.env)**:  
   This file contains server-related configurations and Docker-related settings. It is located in the root directory of the project: `Tombolo/Tombolo`.

2. **Client-Specific Environment File**:  
   This file is specific to the client-side application and is located in `Tombolo/Tombolo/client-reactjs`.

> **Important**: It is essential to review and understand the variables in these files as they may differ depending on your environment. Detailed explanations for each variable are provided below.
