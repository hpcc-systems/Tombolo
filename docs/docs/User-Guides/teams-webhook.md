# Microsoft Teams Webhooks

Webhooks in Microsoft Teams allow Tombolo to deliver notifications and updates directly into a Teams channel. Webhooks post these updates directly into the chat stream which can be handled and responded to in order to keep your team on top of important notifications.

## Add the webhook to Tombolo

Navigate to the creation screen by selecting "MS Teams" under the "Notifications" menu, under the "Settings" section of the left-hand navigation.

In the top right hand corner, click or select the "Add new project" button.

Name is used as the reference field when selecting the webhook as a notification option throughout the application.

The URL needs to be configured for your teams channel by following microsofts guide https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet
