# Applications

Applications provide a way to seperate groups of data and settings inside of Tombolo. Each application has its own set of Monitorings, and Notifications as well as administration settings. You can switch application instances at any time by utilizing the selector in the top left corner of the navigation bar, by the Tombolo logo.

Common use cases for multiple applications are departments with several divisions where each division wants to maintain its own data and notifications, but be hosted on the same instance.

### Applications share:

Environment Variables, such as API key valid time period, Cluster Whitelists, and Email Configurations

Database

Host Machine Settings, such as firewalls.

### Applications do not share:

Monitorings

Notifications

Dashboard Data

### Visibility

Public - Public applications are visible to any user that has login credentials to the Tombolo Instance.

Private - Private applications are only visible to the user who creates the instance, and other administrators of the Tombolo Instance.

## Create an Application

Navigate to the Application management and creation screen by selecting "Applications" under the "Admin" section of the left-hand navigation.

In the top right hand corner, click or select the "Add Application" button.

Enter a title, description, and select whether the application should be private or public. A private application is only available to your user and anybody you share it with, a public application is available to any user who has access to the tombolo installation.
