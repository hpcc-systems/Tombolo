[ Pre ] Create current date time
1. get all job monitoring
2. Group monitoring by cluster
3. Get cluster info for each cluster ( including username and password)
4. For each cluster create workunit service 
5. Get WU that were executed in past 30 min for each cluster
    5.A. check cluster time zone offset and last scanned date to calculate what 30 mins ago is
    5.B. If no last scanned is available just use offset to perform calculation
6. Check if any of those work unit's job name match 
7. For all matching make call to cluster and get complete details about each WU
8. The job monitoring with the matching job name needs to be updated. Save them in an array []
9. Check if notification conditions such as [Failed, Aborted and Unknown match]
9.A. If matched - push appropriate details to notificationsToBeSent array
10. Check other notification Conditions [not started on time, not completed on time ]
    Find the expected run / complete window based on timezone where cluster is running and run/completion time  
    If past run time and the run time is not within the window - push appropriate details to notification queue
11. Finally update job monitoring 
12. Finally update notification queue

# Handle error in each iteration, if one item in iteration fails - keep going
# Roll back if one of the update  fails

Question - Is one monitoring for one job 
           What if one monitoring match multiple jobs
