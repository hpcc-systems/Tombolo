## For later  :
1. Add spinner when jobs are being searched, when domain and products are being searched.
2. when pattern entered show list of file that match the pattern so users know the pattern they entered is correct
3. Add info (Help) on schedular picker, revisit existing help docs
4. if user selects 20,30,31 dates under monthly show warning saying - some months do not have this date
5. Enable  disable of irrelevant dates (e.g., 29th, 30th) when a monthly schedule is chosen
6. Change approval to drop down and give option to start when approved
7. Make run window editable, when changed empty start and end time and also display on details modal

## Before submitting  PR
1. jobMonitoring.js change poller to run every 30 mins
2. Test job patterns

##  Non related to Job monitoring
1. Same Integration appearing in redux multiple time. This occurrence does not impact functionality or performance,
   investigate  the root cause behind it for clarity and understanding.
2. It would be nice to have a config file for schedulers/pollers where interval for pollers and other constants can be adjusted easily 

## Questions : 
1. Every workunit undergoes an unknown state which should not be considered as failed. However, ASR monitoring currently interprets it as failed. Tombolo, on the other hand, considers this state as intermediate.
2. If a workunit is in an intermediate state and the required completion status is set to "NO," would you proceed by acknowledging that the job has started within the designated window and move forward without concern about whether the job will be completed or fail?
3. For follow-up emails, the timing of when these should be sent out has not been clarified in the documentation.

When row is selected enable action buttons only for that row,
when more than 1 selected disable all
